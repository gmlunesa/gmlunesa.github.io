                  visit around. I'm a software engineer with almost 5 years
                  experience in developing applications. I love learning new
                  things and witnessing the technological advances in this
                  so-called "Fourth Industrial Revolution".

                  In my experience as a software engineer, I have two main
                  roles: solve bugs and create new features. Which do I like
                  better? Well, both! Defect solution and functionality
                  implementations are challenging and fullfilling to do.

                  Going through Agile workflows in my past and current
                  employement, I have experienced multiple roles in a team.
                  Aside from being a standard dev, I have undergone being a team
                  leader, a business analyst and even a QA. One thing that I
                  discovered about myself through these occassional role
                  shifting is that, I have an inclination towards managing
                  resources, negotiating requirements and organizing
                  documentation. Perhaps that could be a track that I could
                  pursue in the future.

                  In my free time, I don't really do much. I like to relax

                  could end here, I don't really do much; but that would be too
                  boring... and empty.

                  taste in things. I basically just go with my current mood and

                  here are timeless favoritesâ€” no matter what mood or location,
                  I'm always down for them.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For movies, I love going back to Middle Earth and root for the
                  best hobbit in the world, Samwise Gamgee. One could never go
                  wrong with Lord of the Rings trilogy (extended verions
                  please). I truly adore the lore of the Middle Earth, and the
                  efforts that JRR Tolkien dedicated in the world building.
                  Although the movies are great adaptations, I still like going
                  back and reading The Lord of the Rings novels.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I am a sucker for the fantasy genre. My favorite literary work
                  is A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin. I love how the
                  characters are written to reflect humanity in real life, with
                  grey morality in characters and complexities in politics. For
                  manga, I highly recommend Shingeki No Kyojin.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For music, the only album I could listen to on repeat forever
                  would be In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel.
                  To be honest, I don't fully understand the whole album, but
                  it's an amazing auditory experience. A close runner up would
                  be the self titled album of GUNSHIP to accompany late night
                  existential thoughts.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Speaking of existential thoughts, I believe Neon Genesis
                  Evangelion delivers that with its exploration in human psyche
                  and emotions. It seems like a mecha early on, but I promise,
                  it is a beautiful melancholic slow burn. Like Breaking Bad!
                  Such a well-crafted show worth the patience and occasional fly
                  swatting attempts. Better Call Saul, its prequel spin-off
                  series, is also exceptional.

                    Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
                  </h3>
                  <h4>I thought not.</h4>

                  It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.
                  Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so
                  wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to
                  create lifeâ€¦ He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he
                  could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some
                  consider to be unnatural. He became so powerfulâ€¦ the only
                  thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually,
                  of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
                  everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his
                  sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not
                  himself.
